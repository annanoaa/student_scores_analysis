Lists students who failed a subject (score less than 50).
Calculates the average score per subject for each semester.
Finds the student(s) with the highest GPA across all semesters and subjects.
Identifies the subject with the lowest average score across all semesters.
Generates a new dataframe with average points of subjects by semester and saves it as an Excel file.
Identifies students who have consistently improved their grades across semesters.
Creates a bar chart showing the average score per subject across all semesters.
Creates a line graph showing the average overall score by semester.

Output
The script generates the following outputs:

Console output with various statistics and analyses.
An Excel file named 'average_points_by_semester.xlsx' with average points by semester.
A PNG file named 'average_points_per_subject.png' showing the bar chart of average scores per subject.
A PNG file named 'average_points_per_semester.png' showing the line graph of average scores by semester.
